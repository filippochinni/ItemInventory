# Item Inventory

IteamInvetory is an App specifically targeted to tidiness-addicts.

Being an organized, tidy and neat person is not always easy, it is hard to always remember where your overly-organized stuff is.

ItemInventory allows you to keep track of the location of your items. You can define an hierarchical disposition of you item as it follows:
- **Site**: the geographical location of your item (Home, Workplace, Parents' house, etc.)
- **Location**: the physical location of the item (specific room, specific piece of furniture, etc.)
- **Compartment**: the specific compartment of the piece of furniture (specific shelf, specific drawer, etc.)
- **Container**: the container in which the Item is (box, plastic container, etc.)
- **Item**: the specified Item

Each Item comes with a set of attributes you can define, such as its category, size and additional notes.<br>
Also the other entities of the hierarchical scale can be further explained with additional information. <br>
Containers can contain other containers, in case the Item is inside a series of multiple containers. <br>


## About

I am a Computer Engineering graduate student, particularly interested in Software Development.<br>
I develop personal programming projects both to fulfill personal necessities and to have fun while exercising programming skills.

This is a "training" Android project, where I develop an App to help myself for a personal issue of mine, which is to always have perfect track of where my stuff is between different locations.
